# FIRMWARE APPLICATION FOR ESP32 DEV-KIT-V1 THAT USES SPIFFS FOR FILE SAVING AND HTTPS FOR FILE DOWNLOAD VIA HTTPS PROTOCOL.
  ##Prerequrisits: 
    1. ESP32 Plugin for Arduino IDE 
    2. SPIFFS File system 
    3. WiFi library and module
    4. WiFi ClientSecure module and HTTP module for ESP32
    5. Arduino IDE version 1.8.18
    NOTE: SPIFFS file systems is not optimized for newer arduino IDE versions, so it is better to use version 1.8.18

## Project Description
  Developed a firmware application for ESP32 Dev-Kit-V1 microcontroller using Arduino IDE & Arduino-ESP32 Plugin, This firmware downloads web file via HTTPS from a public URL and writes it to SPIFFS(SPI flash file system) at a speed of at least 150KBps 
  *Implemented WiFi connectivity that uses WiFi modules for internet connectivity. 
  * Implemented “Https Client-secure” module for Web connectivity, Https GET requests
  * Implemented SPIFFS(SPI-Flash File system) that creates files for storage of packet data.
  * The project is implemented using ESP32 Plugin for Arduino IDE & SPI-Flash file system.
